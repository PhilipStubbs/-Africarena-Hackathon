### Problem
There is a lack of predictability regarding minibus taxi and train schedules in Cape Town, hampering
passenger mobility, impacting socio-economic development, and reducing passenger safety.
The Challenge
To give passengers visibility of train and taxi locations, the teams need to develop a cell phone-based
App that improves predictability in travel time in an unscheduled environment

| Instructions  |
| ------------- |
| The app should indicate the location of passengers currently on a train or taxi, with route
information, to users of the app that are waiting for the taxi or train on that specific route.
 The teams must assume that route and schedule data for the trains and taxis exists.
 This app should enable passenger to passenger cell phone communication, possibly with a
communication hub.
 As low as possible data cost, including Map data if included in the solution.
 Anonymity between users.
 The app must be potentially transferable outside of Cape Town.
 In addition, the data sent from the app should be stored in a central repository to be used
for analysis and planning purposes.
 Safety and revenue stream features can also be explored if time permits. These are not
required as part of the solution.
 The app must be user friendly
 The app must be scalable and able to be improved upon fairly easily|
